So blood is often a symbol of life.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"> But blood can also be a symbol of death since if too much blood comes out (because of being injured or sick), that person or animal will die.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"> When people made sacrifices to God, they killed an animal and poured its blood on the altar. God told them to kill the animal in their place so they would not have to be killed as punishment for their sins. </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"> Jesus died as the perfect sacrifice. His blood symbolically covers our sins and cleanses us from them.</div></li></ul></div><h2 class="sectionedit3" id="examples-from-the-bible-stories">Examples from the Bible stories:</h2><div class="level2"><ul><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong><a href="/en/notes/frames/08-03" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:frames:08-03">[08-03]</a></strong> Before Joseph&#039;s brothers returned home, they tore Joseph’s robe and dipped it in goat&#039;s <strong>blood</strong>.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong><a href="/en/notes/frames/10-03" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:frames:10-03">[10-03]</a></strong> God turned the Nile River into <strong>blood</strong>, but Pharaoh still would not let the Israelites go.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong><a href="/en/notes/frames/11-05" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:frames:11-05">[11-05]</a></strong> All the houses of the Israelites had <strong>blood</strong> around the doors, so God passed over those houses and everyone inside was safe.
