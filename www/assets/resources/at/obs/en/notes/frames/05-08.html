God wanted to see that Abraham loved God more than he loved his son and would obey God even when God told him to give his son back to God. </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>Stop! Do no hurt the boy!</strong> - God protected Isaac and kept Abraham from killing him.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>you fear me</strong> - Abraham feared God, which included respect and reverence for God. Because of those things, he obeyed God.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>your only son</strong> - Ishmael was also Abraham&#039;s son, but Isaac was the only son of Abraham and Sarah.
