Lazarus and his two sisters, <strong>Mary</strong> and Martha, were close friends of Jesus. When Jesus heard this news, he said, “<strong>This sickness will not end in <a href="/en/key-terms/death" class="wikilink1" title="en:key-terms:death">death</a></strong>, but <strong>it is for the <a href="/en/key-terms/glory" class="wikilink1" title="en:key-terms:glory">glory</a> of <a href="/en/key-terms/god" class="wikilink1" title="en:key-terms:god">God</a></strong>.” Jesus <strong><a href="/en/key-terms/love" class="wikilink1" title="en:key-terms:love">loved</a></strong> his friends, <strong>but he waited where he was for two days</strong>. </p></div><h2 class="sectionedit2" id="translation-notes">Translation Notes:</h2><div class="level2"><ul><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>One day</strong> - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time.
