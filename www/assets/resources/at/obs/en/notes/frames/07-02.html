Esau said to <strong><a href="/en/key-terms/jacob" class="wikilink1" title="en:key-terms:jacob">Jacob</a></strong>, “Please <strong>give me some of the food</strong> you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, <strong>give me your rights as the oldest son</strong>.” So Esau gave Jacob his <strong>rights as the oldest son</strong>. Then Jacob gave him some food. </p></div><h2 class="sectionedit2" id="translation-notes">Translation Notes:</h2><div class="level2"><ul><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>give me some of the food … give me your rights</strong> – Some languages may prefer to use two different words for “give” here. This would also apply to, “Esau gave … Jacob gave” in the last two sentences.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>rights as the oldest son</strong> - According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father&#039;s wealth when their father died.
