It can also be translated as, “Olive Tree Hill.” </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>abandon me</strong> – That is, “desert me” or, “leave me.” </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>It is written</strong> - That is, “It is written in God&#039;s word” or, “It is written in the scriptures” or, “One of God&#039;s prophets wrote.” It is also possible to say, “What is written will happen” or, “It will be like what is written.” This prophecy refers to Jesus&#039; death and his followers running away. </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>I will strike</strong> - That is, “I will kill.” </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>the shepherd and all the sheep</strong> - Do not use Jesus&#039; name in this quote because the prophet who first wrote it would not have known the shepherd&#039;s name. Also, do not refer to the sheep being the disciples. It is best to use words that mean “shepherd” and “sheep” in your translation.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>will be scattered</strong> - That is, “will go away in different directions.” </div></li></ul><p><strong><a href="/en/notes/frames/38-07" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:frames:38-07">&lt;&lt;</a> | <a href="/en/obs/notes/38" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:38">Up</a> | <a href="/en/notes/frames/38-09" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:frames:38-09">&gt;&gt;</a></strong></p></div>
