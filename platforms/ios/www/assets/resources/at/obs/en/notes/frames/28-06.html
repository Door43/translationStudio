If camels are not known in your language area, a phrase such as, “very large animal” or, “beast of burden” could be used. If you choose to substitute the name of some other large animal, make sure that the animal would have been known by the people Jesus was talking to, such as, “ox” or, “donkey.” </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>eye of a needle</strong> - This refers to the tiny hole in the end of a sewing needle.
