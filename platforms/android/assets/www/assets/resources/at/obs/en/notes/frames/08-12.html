When they protected their youngest brother, Joseph knew they had changed.</div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>if they had changed</strong> - Another way to say this would be, “if they were different than they used to be.” Years ago Joseph&#039;s brothers sold him into slavery. Joseph wanted to find out if they would now do what was right. </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>do not be afraid</strong> - Another way to say this would be, “You do not need to fear any punishment from me.” Joseph&#039;s brothers were afraid because they had greatly wronged Joseph and now as a great ruler he had the power to punish them. Joseph could refuse to sell them food, or even put them in prison or kill them. </div></li><li class="level1"><div class="li"><strong>evil for good</strong> - Joseph&#039;s brothers did an evil thing when they sold Joseph as a slave and he was taken to Egypt. But God allowed this so that Joseph could save thousands of people from starving during the famine, including his own family. This was a very good thing. </div></li></ul><p><strong><a href="/en/notes/frames/08-11" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:frames:08-11">&lt;&lt;</a> | <a href="/en/obs/notes/08" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:08">Up</a> | <a href="/en/notes/frames/08-13" class="wikilink1" title="en:obs:notes:frames:08-13">&gt;&gt;</a></strong></p></div>
